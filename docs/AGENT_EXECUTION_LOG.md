### PR #35 — feat: Instruction Quick Approve UI (Backlog #9)

#### CEO/Product Decision

- Task: **Backlog #9 — Instruction Quick Approve UI**
- Why: `/instructions/pending` currently redirects users to raw API docs to approve. `InstructionActions` component already has full Approve/Block inline UI. One-file UI change that makes the control room usable without API knowledge.
- Out of scope: Project Registry (schema migration), Rate Limiting, GitHub integration, Browser Auth
- Confirmed repo-only work: yes

#### CTO/Architecture Review

- Files touched: `src/app/instructions/pending/page.tsx` only
- API impact: none (uses existing `PATCH /api/instructions/[id]`)
- DB impact: none — added in-memory task grouping via JavaScript Map
- Auth impact: none
- Rollback plan: revert `src/app/instructions/pending/page.tsx` — no DB state affected
- No unnecessary schema or architecture change: confirmed

#### CISO/Safety Review

- No secrets involved
- No new endpoints
- No auth/RBAC changes
- `InstructionActions` uses existing validated endpoint with all guards intact
- Risk: Low

#### Implementation Summary

- Modified `src/app/instructions/pending/page.tsx`:
  - Group instructions by task (JavaScript Map, no extra DB query)
  - Each task group shows: task link, risk badge, env badge, pending count
  - Replaced "Review →" link with embedded `InstructionActions` component (inline Approve/Block UI)
  - Removed raw API hint text at bottom
  - No other files modified

#### QA/Test Summary

- Backlog #9 spec: "None required (UI interaction test only)"
- All 197 existing tests pass
- Build clean: `npm run build` — `/instructions/pending` listed as `ƒ 1.34 kB`

### Next Selected Task

**Backlog #10 — Risk Analyzer: Fuzz Test + Expand Negation Patterns**
- Expand `stripNegatedClauses()` with 10+ additional patterns
- Add 20+ adversarial fuzz tests
- Closes M-PI1 from SECURITY_GAP_ANALYSIS.md

### Blockers / Deferred

- Backlog #1 (Project Registry Schema): deferred — schema migration, requires Rahul
- Backlog #12 (Browser Auth): deferred — high risk, requires Rahul
- Backlog #4 (GitHub Webhook): deferred — security-critical new endpoint, requires Rahul sign-off
